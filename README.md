        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Leo holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and is currently a Master's student at Stanford University with concentration in Fluid Mechanics & Heat Transfer. 
            He is a member of the NanoHeat Lab under PI Prof. Ken Goodson and Prof. Mehdi Asheghi. His research involves single- and two-phase thermal management 
            of high-power-density electronics. Experiences include mechanical design, thermal & fluids systems design and validation, CAE, and manufacturing. 
            Planned graduation in March 2026. Oh also, he loves working on cars and hopes to one day drive a stick shift again.</p>
